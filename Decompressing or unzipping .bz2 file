**Explanation steps of the above code:**

1. Importing the `bz2` module: The `bz2` module in Python provides functions for working with .bz2 files.

2. Specifying the file paths: In the code snippet, you need to specify the path to the .bz2 file that you want to unzip. The variable `file_path` holds the path to the .bz2 file.

3. Specifying the output file name and path: The variable `output_file` is used to specify the name and path of the output file where the contents of the .bz2 file will be saved after extraction.

4. Opening the .bz2 file for reading: The `bz2.open()` function is used to open the .bz2 file specified by `file_path` in binary mode for reading. It returns a file object, which is assigned to the variable `source_file`.

5. Opening the output file for writing: The `open()` function is used to open the output file specified by `output_file` in binary mode for writing. It returns a file object, which is assigned to the variable `output`.

6. Reading and writing the contents: The `source_file.read()` function reads the entire content of the .bz2 file, and `output.write()` writes the content to the output file.

7. Closing the files: The `with` statement takes care of automatically closing the files (`source_file` and `output`) after their respective blocks of code.

8. Printing a completion message: After the extraction is complete, the code prints the message "Unzipping complete."

#In the code snippet, `'rb'` is a mode argument passed to the `bz2.open()` function and the `open()` function.

#In Python, file objects can be opened in different modes to specify how the file should be accessed. Here's what `'rb'` represents:

#`'r'`: This indicates that the file should be opened for reading.

#`'b'`: This indicates that the file should be treated as a binary file. In binary mode, file data is read or written as a sequence of bytes, rather than as text.

#By specifying `'rb'`, we are opening the .bz2 file in binary mode for reading. Similarly, the `open()` function is used with `'wb'` mode to open the output file in binary mode for writing.

#It's important to note that when working with .bz2 files, we typically want to read or write them in binary mode because they are compressed binary files.

Note: Make sure to replace `'test.ft.txt.bz2'` with the correct path to your .bz2 file and `'output.txt'` with the desired output file name and path.
